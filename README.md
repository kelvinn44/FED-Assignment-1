# FED-Assignment-1

I am doing a website for 5 Seconds of Summer, often shortened to 5SOS. 5SOS is an Australian pop rock band that consists of four members: Luke Hemmings (lead vocals and rhythm guitar), Michael Clifford (lead guitar and vocals), Calum Hood (bass and vocals), and Ashton Irwin (drums and vocals). When I was visiting their official website, I found it to be quite bland, so I'm revamping it to make it more engaging and informative. I've created a home, about, merch, and tour page for this project. Users can find out more about the band's history, albums, videos, merch, or make a request for them to play for you and their tour schedule on this website.
 
## Design Process
 
As a user of this website, I would want to use it to find out more about 5 Seconds of Summer. For example in the home page i can check out videos they have, images, and even sign up for updates via email. I can also get to know more about the band's history, members, and discography when I'm on the about page. Furthermore, in the merch page, as a user, I would want to browse merch from the band. Lastly, as a user, I would want to make a request for them to play for me or see their tour schedule in the tour page.

## Features 
### Existing Features
1. In the home page, user can click on either the left or right button in the video carousel to browse through videos from the band.
2. In the footer of every page, user can click on the different social icons to go to the band official medias.

### Features Left to Implement
- Album carousel to browse through the various albums from the band in the about page.
- The band tour schedule list in the tour page.
- Add item to cart in the merch page (if possible).

## Testing

Responsiveness has not been implemented yet, so it will look bad on smaller screen sizes. (To be completed in the final submission)
